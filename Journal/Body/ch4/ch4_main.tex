\section{Methods and procedures}

This is the opening paragraph to my thesis which
explains in general terms the concepts and hypothesis
which will be used in my thesis.

With more general information given here than really
necessary.

\section{Introduction}

Here initial concepts and conditions are explained and
several hypothesis are mentioned in brief.

As can be seen in Table~\ref{nothing} it is truly
obvious what I am saying is true.
