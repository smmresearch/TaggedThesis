%The above command is for use with VSCode as an editor - can be deleted for others

%%%%%%% Instructions %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%Use lualatex to compile with --interaction-mode=nonstopmode
%The commands I run are of the form (in the folder containing thesis.tex): 

%lualatex --aux-directory=./LatexAux --synctex=1 --interaction=nonstopmode --c-style-errors .\thesis.tex
%biber thesis --output-directory=.\LatexAux  

%biber's output-directory should match lualatex's aux-directory or both should be omitted. c-style-errors is optional.

% If using unicode with lualatex, do not use amssymb, input/output enc
% Don't take any warning/error seriously until it persists over multiple compilations
% Get Error ".. \@ doesn't match definition.."? 
% First, make sure you have ran biber and re-ran lualatex
% Then, try deleting *.aux file of file you were messing with. If needed, escalate to deleting all auxillary files.

%% Includegraphics, Tikz, and \begin{picture}...\end{picture} figures are supported natively with tagging - see examples in the template
%% However, more obscure options for generating figures (like the xy package) are not
%% Suggestion:
%% Generate such a figure as a standalone pdf (use document class {standalone} with normal preamble and no tagging) and use includegraphics to add alt text


%%% While drafting, the class options no-mathml and/or no-tag-tree can speed up compiling.
% no-tag-tree cannot be used for final submission. mathml accessiblity tagging is not currently required by ISU

% Template file for a standard thesis
\documentclass[12pt,math-packages,algorithms-packages]{isuthesistagged}
%packages always loaded in cls file: xpatch, fancyhdr, titlesec, setspace, nowidow, caption
%           subcaption, geometry, graphicx
%biblatex and hyperref must also be loaded later in the preamble




%Additional class options:
% draft: disables most of tagging, loading of figures, and other "expensive" tasks. Makes compilation much faster. Ignore any warnings from tagpdf when this option is on.
%       Cannot be used for final submission. Automatically includes the option no-mathml and no-tag-tree.
% math-packages: loads amsmath,amsthm, mathtools, and associated tagging fixes
% algorithms-packages: loads algorithm, algpseudocode, fixes the numbering and tagging, also provides \parstate for long, wrapped states
% no-mathml: disables math tagging (not required by Iowa State)
% no-tag-tree: disables a slow part of tagging (must be re-enabled before submission)
% bib-no-break: by default, page breaks in the middle of bibliography entries are discouraged, but may happen for a particularly long entry (4+ lines).
%       With this option, a page break will never happen in the middle of an entry, no matter how long. This is "recommended" but not required
%       by Iowa State.

%Instead of fontsetup and unicode-math, you
%can use lmodern for a classic (not-unicode) Computer Modern font
%However, without unicode, the accessibility of the math formulas
%is much worse (currently ISU has no requirements about

% IMPORTANT NOTES
% TABLE OF CONTENTS : First consider if the bib-no-break option above does what you want.
% TOPIC 1:  If you need a page break follow the steps below
% step1
% check before which chapter in the table of contents you want a page break
% step 2
% go the folder "body". There open the chapter tex file that you noted needed page break in the table of contents..
% step 3
% insert  \addtocontents{toc}{\protect\newpage} before the first line i.e. before the line \chapter{RESULTS}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% IN ORDER TO MAKE spacing changes in the title page got to the section in the isuthesis.cls file
% that starts with \long\def\maketitle{\begin{titlepage} and you can change the vskip/vspace amounts throughout

% use \caption{} for all captions of figures and tables, where the captions are not too long.

% Use \caption[]{} with the square brackets for short caption of figure or table that goes into the list of tables and list of figures, and the curly brackets can have long captions which go with the figure/ table.
