The other direction is already known, which implies that strong monotypy and the generating property for polytopes are the same notion. A criterion for monotypic and strongly monotypic polytopes is also given.},

In this paper we introduce graph homotopy for graphs and Graham homotopy for hypergraphs, and study the relation between these homotopies and the simplehomotopy for simplicial complexes. The graph homotopy is useful to describe topological properties of discretized geometric figures, while the Graham homotopy is essential to characterize acyclic hypergraphs and acyclic relational database schemes.},

We assume that the index set is compact and that the data functions are upper semicontinuous with respect to the index variable (actually, this assumption will only affect the set of ε-active indices at the reference point). As in the previous work, we do not require any continuity assumption with respect to the decision variable. The current compact setting gives rise to more explicit formulas, which only involve subdifferentials at the reference point of active data functions. Other formulas are derived under weak continuity assumptions. These formulas reduce to the characterization given by Valadier [18, Theorem 2] when the supremum function is continuous.},

  abstract     = {The notion of a contractible transformation on a graph was introduced by Ivashchenko as a means to study molecular spaces arising from digital topology and computer image analysis, and more recently has been applied to topological data analysis. Contractible transformations involve a list of four elementary moves that can be performed on the vertices and edges of a graph, and it has been shown by Chen, Yau, and Yeh that these moves preserve the simple homotopy type of the underlying clique complex. A graph is said to be I-contractible if one can reduce it to a single isolated vertex via a sequence of contractible transformations. Inspired by the notions of collapsible and non-evasive simplicial complexes, in this paper we study certain subclasses of I-contractible graphs where one can collapse to a vertex using only a subset of these moves. Our main results involve constructions of minimal examples of graphs for which the resulting classes differ. We also relate these classes of graphs to the notion of k-dismantlable graphs and k-collapsible complexes, which also leads to a minimal counterexample to an erroneous claim of Ivashchenko from the literature. We end with some open questions.},

If we take the partially ordered set \$\$\textbackslash Omega \_h\$\$of all compactBody complete sets of diameter h in n-dimensional Euclidean space ordered by inclusion, complete bodies are precisely the maximal elements of \$\$\textbackslash Omega \_h\$\$. That is, a compact set A in \$\$\textbackslash Omega \_h\$\$is a maximal element of \$\$\textbackslash Omega \_h\$\$, or a complete body, if A is equal to B whenever A is contained in B, for B in \$\$\textbackslash Omega \_h\$\$. The two main results of this chapter are that complete bodies are precisely bodies of constant width h, and that every element of \$\$\textbackslash Omega \_h\$\$is contained in a maximal body; that is, that it can be completed to a body of constant width. These results are known as the Theorems of Meissner and Pál, respectively. Section 7.4 will be devoted to the study of reduced convex bodies, a notion somehow “dual” to completeness, and in Section 7.5 we complete convex bodies preserving some of their original characteristics, such as symmetries.},

Yost, we show that in a generic Minkowski space of dimension at least three the set of diametrically complete sets is not closed under the operation of adding a ball.

We introduce a new concept of locally dominated vertices in a simplicial complex, upon which our proof strategy is based. This allows us to deduce the contractibility of the Rips complexes from a local geometric condition called local crushing. In the case of the integer lattices in dimension n and a fixed scale r, this condition entails the comparison of finitely many distances to conclude that the corresponding Rips complex is contractible. In particular, we are able to verify that for n = 1, 2, 3, the Rips complex of the n-dimensional integer lattice at scale greater or equal to n is contractible. We conjecture that the same proof strategy can be used to extend this result to all dimensions n.},
