Where to find Latex Official Documentation around Tagging:
Some of it is here: 
https://latex3.github.io/tagging-project/

If you have problem, the issues of this official repository have alot of answers (and if you have done your research carefully, you can also contribute):
github.com/latex3/tagging-project/

The maintainers of Latex are also active on: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tagged-pdf
Urlike Fischer, Joseph Wright, David Carlisle are on the Latex official team

The ISO Standard for PDF is still being refined. You can see issues others have brought up on this official repository of the PDF Association:
https://github.com/pdf-association/pdf-issues/
(I'll note, unlike the tagging-project, I don't think the PDF Association wants outside contributors, so be a silent observer.)


Much of the core tagging code, especially for paragraphs, is located in tagpdf, which, with its associated documentation, is here:
https://ctan.org/pkg/tagpdf

However, much of the more specific tagging utilities and its associated documentation is located in the latex-lab set of files:
https://ctan.org/pkg/latex-lab

This includes the tagging specific to tables, figures, and math.
