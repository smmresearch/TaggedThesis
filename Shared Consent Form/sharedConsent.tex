% Need to load a font for the checkboxes that supports the empty and checked boxes (many do not)
% Deja Vu Sans is one option (to be clear, this does not need to match any other font you may use)
% DejaVu Sans is available to install at https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/Download.html.
% To use do: \newfontfamily\stix{DejaVu Sans} 
% in the preamble of the whole document. This won't change the font, just allows us to use the
% font just for the checkboxes. The rest of the text will be in your main body font of choice.
% Copy & paste: ☐ for unchecked and ☒ are checked
